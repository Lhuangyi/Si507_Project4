# Si507_Project4
## INTRODUCTION
In this project, I used python module: BeautifulSoup to scrape data from the National Parks website: https://www.nps.gov/index.htm 

## SCRAPE DATA
In the National Park Website, there are lots of states. For each state, I scraped data representing all National Sites.
  ### Type of data
*Name of site
*Type of site
*Description of site 
*Name of State

## LOAD DATA
I used caching for all of my data so I don't make too many requests to the site 

## OUTPUT DATA
Output a csv file to show all the scraping data.
